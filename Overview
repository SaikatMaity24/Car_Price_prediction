This project aims to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model for predicting car prices. 
Accurate price predictions are crucial for buyers, sellers, and insurance companies to make informed 
decisions. Leveraging historical data on car sales, including variables such as make, model, year, mileage, 
engine size, and other relevant features, we explore various machine learning algorithms to find the most 
effective model.Our methodology includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. 
We experiment with different models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient 
Boosting Machines, to evaluate their performance based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
The results indicate that the Random Forest model outperforms others in terms of accuracy and robustness.
This project not only provides insights into the significant factors influencing car prices but also presents 
a scalable solution for real-world applications in the automotive industry. Future work will focus on incorporating 
additional data sources and refining the model to improve prediction accuracy further.
